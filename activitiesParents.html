						<h2>Get Your Kids Switched Off, Active and Motivated</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="small-6 large-6 columns">
						<p>The first step in motivating your child to live a healthy and active lifestyle is to change your ways. Your child isn&#39t going to want to swap their unhealthy habits without seeing the benefits for themselves, let them see it in you.</p> 
						<p>The second step is to remember you are their parent, you are not their ally.  Don&#39t pander to their complaints and lack of desire to be active. Your kids need you to be firm, let them know that they are not in charge, when you tell them it&#39s time to exercise or screen off time, there should be no negotiating. When its off time it&#39s off time, and time to get moving.</p> 

						<p>The third step is to encourage them to use and experience healthy language, try to eliminate as much critical language as possible. Your child will not be encourage to eat healthy if you reprimand them in public for over eating. Avoid phrases like “you&#39ve had too much to eat” change it to “do you think you might have had enough?” </p>
					</div>
					<div class="small-6 large-6 columns">
						<p>Teach them that a healthy lifestyle is about balance, eating well, keeping active, sleeping enough, and viewing yourself with a can do attitude {ugh}.</p>

						<p>Get you kids to talk before they eat, ask them whether they want food because they are actually hungry or because they are bored, sad, tired. Remember they respond well to being talked to like grownups, don&#39t talk down or belittle them.</p>

						<h2>Goal Setting to Motivate the Unmotivated</h2>

						<p>Write down your health/exercise goals keep it tacked on a board  inside the kitchen or child’s bedroom.</p>
						<p>Think about why you need these goals/why they are important to the child.</p>
						<p>Make a plan for each goal.</p>
						<p>Don&#39t make the time limit impossible/be reasonable, take into account possible setbacks. </p>
						<p>Have a weekly or monthly evaluation of where the child is in regards to their goal</>
						<p>Make a list along with your child, have the same constraints as them, if they have to be healthy so do you, if they have to join a club so do you. </p>

						<h2>Having activities you do with your children will encourage them to stay of their screens and keep moving.</h2>
						<p> On weekends organise family/neighbourhood games.
							<ul>
								<li> Scavenger Hunts</li>
								<li> Family Olympics </li>
								<li> On rainy days make your house an obstacle course, teach them dances from your youth i.e. Macarena.</li>
								<li> Make old cardboard boxes into racing cars and race in the garden/park/street/hallway.</li>

						<h2>Keep Them Switched Off</h2>
							<p>During the usual TV/computer inactive hours try and teach your kids some interesting activities that you did in your childhood. </p>
							<p>Ideas include:
								<ul>
									<li>Red light-Green light</li>
									<li>Stuck in the mud</li>
									<li>Handball-foursquare</li>
									<li>Clapping games</li>
									<li>Tag</li>

						<h2>Monkey see monkey do</h2>
						<p>Your children idealise you, they have been mimicking your behaviour since birth, use this to your advantage. </p>
						<p>Do stretches or yoga in the house and encourage them to join. </p>
						<p>Take them to the gym with you or to a class. </p>
						<p>If you go for runs around the park, take your kids with you, they can ride their bikes, rollerblade, walk beside you.</p> 
						<p>Do you or your partner play a sport? Bring them along to watch. </p>
						<p>The more healthy and active a lifestyle your children witness the better chance that when it comes time for their activities and sports they will  take pride in being similar to mummy and daddy. </p>
						<p>The less they see you being inactive the less inactive they will learn to be. </p>

						<h2>Build Your Kids Up</h2>
							<ul class="no-bullet">
								<li>
									<h4>Praise them</h4>
									<p>Praise them for the little and big things, you want your child to feel they are worth something. When a child is overweight their self confidence is low, it’s your job as a parent to build them up, so that when it does come time for the hard stuff [exercise] they have that voice in the back of their mind reminding them that they are capable.</p> 
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Hear them out</h4>
									<p>Ask them about themselves, what do they think they can and cannot do? What do they look up to in others? What do they see as attributes that need work in themselves, and those that they themselves have pride over?</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Lead by example</h4>
									<p>Try to avoid talking about your own body issues in front of your children, they pick up on the phrases and will soon learn to think in the same way. Try to eliminate negative body image talk, and begin using words like muscle, definition, strength.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Nudge but don’t push</h4>
									<p>Your kids need to go at a pace that they are comfortable with, but remember the timeline from off the couch to fit is not definitive, they need encouragement to get their but don’t pressure them, the harder you push the less they will want to do it. Kids are stubborn if they think that this is all their  your idea they want be as proactive as if they believe its their own desire. </p>
									<p>Your child is most likely afraid of failing or looking bad while attempting some new sport or activity, be there for them, nudge them beyond that fear, but again don’t push.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Discourage label usage</h4>
									<p>Kids are more than just one thing, yes they may be large, they may be shy, they might like science fiction more than average, but each child has levels. </p>
									<p>Encourage the different aspects of your child an discourage them from labelling themselves from their most dominate personality quirk. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Teach them accountability</h4>
									<p>Give them responsibility and goals, try active outdoor ones like watering the garden, mowing the lawn, cleaning the car.</p>
									<p>This gets them off the couch, outside, and a sense of responsibility and self efficacy. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Let them  to problem solve</h4>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<div class="small-12 large-12 columns">
						<p> Remember you don’t have to have them enrolled in a hundred different afterschool sports or activities  getting them fit and active can be a simple as changing half an hour of TV time  to skip on a rope or play ball outside, making chores into an adventure [i.e. when cleaning up or putting clothes away make it an adventure turn the floor to lave and only certain surfaces can be stepped on] {change the examples}.  Stepping up for your kids isn’t about changing your kids find activities that suit their personalities and similar interests, do your kids like fantasy heroic computer games? Look into karate, archery, medieval action groups. </p>
