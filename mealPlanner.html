						Weekday Meal Planners for Busy Families!
					</h1>

						<p>It can be challenging to come up with quick and healthy meals for children that are both lunch-box  and child friendly.</p>

						<p>Attached to this page is a basic weekly meal planner that you can print off and stick to your fridge/cupboard door that can help you plan meals that promote healthy eating habits.</p>

						Benefits of Using a Meal Planner
					</h4>
						<ul> 
							<li>
								<p>You can save money! No more feeding the bin, planning meals can give you a real advantage when shopping for ingredients and ensuring you don't waste your hard earned money buying food that may not get eaten. You can also buy in bulk and use left-overs for dishes the next day 
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Shopping is made much easier - you can plan your shopping online if that saves you time. Online shopping allows users to save basic ingredient lists and this can cut out hours driving to the supermarket, parking the car and wandering around the aisles. With saved shopping lists you can easily review your weekly staples and hit the send button. Ingredients are delivered to your door.
							</li>
							<li>
								<p> By involving your children you can get better buy-in from them around their food choices. This can enable great discussion on what makes food healthy and why choosing fruit and vegetables is a better option than biscuits and other processed food.
							</li>
						</ul>

						Tips
					</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Get your children to look through cook-books and recipes with you to get their buy-in when deciding what is on the menu. This will go a long way towards them actually eating your lovingly prepared meals!</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Get your children to help you prepare their meals. Children are more likely to try new foods if they have a chance to handle the ingredients first. They may even sneak a taste of those green beans while preparing them!</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Try to review your weekly meal plan with your children on the weekend â€“ particularly what will be going into their lunch box. It can be overwhelming for children to think about what they are going to eat on Friday when it is several days away, so keep the conversation generic. Ie, what fruit do you like eating? What are your favorite sandwich fillings?</p>
							</li>
							<li>
									<p>If your child has really enjoyed their dinner, is it worth considering sending it to school for lunch?</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
