		<h1>Mythbusters!</h1>
		<p> There is a lot of conflicting food fad and exercise trends out there at the moment. Never has there been a time where there has been more information available to parents and carers around what foods should be encouraged and what exercise is the best. Not all this information is true - much is anecdotal, sensational and can fall into the realm of 'pseudo-science'.</p>
		<p> What this section aims to do is to dispel some of the common myths around food and exercise. We will do this by referring to proven and up-to-date scientific research, and links to our sources will be provided so you can do your own further research. Where there is a popular idea but little research - we will reference that too so you have all the information available. We will also include links to other sites that you may find of interest. Here we go! </p>

			The Food Pyramid vs The Food Plate	
			Since 2011 there has been a shift from looking at the Food Pyramid as a guide to what we should eat to the Food Plate. the key difference is that fruits and vegetables should form half of a person's diet as opposed to breads and grains. Vegetables should form more than fruit, with grains forming slightly more than protein.
