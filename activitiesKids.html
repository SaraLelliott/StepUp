			                    <img src="./img/backyardcricket.jpg">
			                    <p> Backyard cricket is a traditional game for many families. Get the kids and the whole family involved in a game of backyard cricket and test the kids out. Learn to throw, catch and most of all, be a good sport! </p>
			                    <h6> Number of Players </h6>
			                    <p> 2 and up! </p>
			                    <h6> What you need: </h6>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li> One or more tennis balls. </li>
			                        <li> A Cricket bat </li>
			                        <li> 2 sets of stumps. (Rubbish bins or chairs work just as well!)</li>
			                    </ul>
			                    <h6> Activity: </h6>

			                   	<p>Set the stumps up about 10 metres apart for older kids, or about 6 metres for littlies.
			                    The batters stump is best put against a fence if in a backyard. </p>

								<p>If just two players, choose your batter and a bowler.</p>
								<p>If more, your bowlers, two batters, and scatter the rest of the kids around to field the ball.
								To avoid squabbles, make sure everyone gets a chance to both bat and bowl.</p>

								<p>Backyard cricket is played just like normal cricket - but there are a few different rules to make it fair.</p>

								<h6> Some rules for extra fun! </h6>
								<ul>
								    <li>Can't go out first ball - whoever's batting, they can't go out on the first ball (making it fairer for little ones).</li>
								    <li>'Tippity-run' - if the ball is hit even a little, the batters have to run.</li>
								    <li>One hand - one bounce' - a fielder can catch the batter out with one hand, even after the tennis ball has bounced off a fence or wall.</li>
								    <li>Any wicket out - the batter can be knocked out if either stump is hit.</li>
								    <li>'Six and out' - if the ball is hit over the fence/ house they are awarded six runs - but are also out (this is where the extra balls come in handy).</li>
								    <li>No LBW's (Leg Before Wicket) - it's too tricky and starts arguments - unless Dad wants to umpire.</li>
								    <li>Automatic runs - pick certain spots in the backyard (like the side of a shed or a fence) and award a certain number of automatic runs to anyone who can hit them.</li>
								    <li>Last one out - the very last batter can keep on going by themselves until caught out.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4 class="subheader"> Cat and Mouse!</h4>
									<img src="./img/catgame.jpg">

										<p>Looking for a great outdoor activity for the kids? Get them into a Cat and mouse game! It's a fast, fun and exciting game to keep the kids laughing and running at your next birthday party or family gathering.</p>

											<h6> Number of players </h6>
										<p> 6 or more </p>

											<h6> Activity: </h6>
										<p>Ask for two volunteers to play the cat and the mouse.</p>
										<p>The other players should form a circle and hold hands.</p>
										<p>The player who is the mouse should stand inside the circle and the cat should stand outside the circle.</p>
										<p>The aim of the game is for the mouse to get outside the circle and avoid being caught by the cat.</p>
										<p>The mouse must stay moving while inside the circle but cannot stay inside the circle for more than 10 seconds.</p>
										<p>The cat cannot come into the circle but they can reach into the circle to grab the mouse.</p>
										<p>The circle players have to try and keep the cat away from the mouse by holding up their hands to let the mouse in and out of the circle.</p>
										<p>They can also block the cat's attempts to grab the mouse by standing in their way.</p>
										<p>If the mouse is caught, the mouse becomes the new cat.</p>
										<p>The old cat takes the place of a player holding hands and another player becomes the mouse.</p>

								<h4 class="subheader"> Backyard Balloon Vollyball!</h4>
								<img src="./img/stupiduglychildren.jpg">
								<p> Get the kids active but without creating chaos during your next party or gathering with a game of balloon volleyball. This twist on an all-time favourite beach volleyball game is fun and easy to play inside or out. </p>
									<h6> Number of Players: </h6>
								<p> 2 or more <p>
									<h6>Activity </h6>
								<p>Set up the "volleyball court" by running a piece of string across the playing space, about 40cm off the ground.</p>
								<p>Divide the players into two teams.</p>
								<p>The two teams must lie on their backs with their feet in the air on each side of the string.</p>
								<p>Decide who goes first. The first player must kick the balloon over the string.</p>
								<p>The teams must kick the balloon back and forth over the string using only their feet and hands while lying on their backs.</p>
								<p>If the balloon touches the floor, the team who missed it allows the other team to gain one point.</p>
								<p>The first team to reach 15 points wins.</p>
