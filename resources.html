						<h2>Congenital</h2>
						<h6>These are conditions that are present at birth. These conditions may be either hereditary or due to an influence occuring during gestation up to the moment of birth.</h6>

						<h3>Congenital Heart Disease</h3>

						<!--obtained from: bodyandsoul.com.au-->
						<p>The causes of congenital heart disease are unknown, though it is thought that genetics, medications and viral infections all play a part. People with a congenital heart disease either have a weak heart due to abnormal heart muscles, heart valve defects which impedes the forward blood flow or hole in the artia and ventricles of the heart allowing oxygenated and unoxygenated blood to mix. It is thought that approximatelt 1 in 100 children are affected by congenital heart disease.</p>

					<h3>Autism</h3>
					<img alt="autism" src="img/autism.jpg" class="smallPic" />
					<!--obtained from: theconversation.com-->
						<p>In essence, Autism affects how the brain processes information by altering how nerve cells (and their synapses) connect and organise. The results include impaired social interactions and communications (both verbal and non-verbal) as well as repetitive behaviour. Whilst not much is known about the causes of autism,  we know it is a neural development disorder with a very broad range of conditions and seriousness. The estimate for Autism is about 15.7 per 1,000 only approx 2 people per thousand present severe cases of Autism.

The extent of spinal bifida varies depending on the location of this cist. In general, spins bifida may result in leg weakness, orthopedic abnormalities, pressure sores or even abnormal eye movements. This congenital disoreder occurs in about 1 pers 1,000 births worldwide, making it one of the most common birth defects. </p>
